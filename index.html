    <strong> Other Information:</strong> Ace is very sweet and submissive dog. His personality is somehting to witness on a daily basis. He loves to run through the grass and play fetch with his variety of bouncy balls. He thinks every time of the day is play time. Even If he is sleep when someone comes outside to see him, he will wake up and run around instantly. He greets everyone the same way by jumping up and trying to get the person's scent. Now that he is out the growing stage and the growning pains of figuring out thw world, he is great around the kids. He has a big heart and he can't be replaced by any other dog.
